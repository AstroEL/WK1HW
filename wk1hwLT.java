/* Git Workflow:
 * 
 * Git workflow is essentially the structure and process enforced in collaborative coding
 * to facilitate accurate and flexible team work in an environment where many small and sensitive 
 * changes to the behind-the-scenes framework are happening at various times. Git workflow 
 * structures primarily focus around a main central repository on a system like GitHub
 * where each user can branch his or her own work to and from the main stem as they pull, commit, 
 * push and merge and ultimately manage any conflicts that arise as the project develops. 
 * Each user involved downloads a clone of the central repository to act as a local backup and 
 * testing ground which ensures added security as well as convenience for making changes.

 * Data Types in Java:
 * 
 * In Java there are two main Data Types namely, primitive data types and object data types.
 * In general, data types are containers or ways to store information for a compiler to read.
 * When we refer to primitive data types in Java, we refer to the most basic data types available
 * in java that contain pure values. Within the primitive data types, there is a division;
 * 		Numeric primitives: short, int, long, float and double.  These primitive data types 
 * 			hold only numeric data. Operations associated with such data types are those of 
 * 			simple arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) or of comparisons (is greater than, 
 * 			is equal to, etc.)
 *		Textual primitives: byte and char. These primitive data types hold characters (that 
 *			can be Unicode alphabets or even numbers). Operations associated with such types are 
 *			those of textual manipulation (comparing two words, joining characters to make words, 
 *			etc.). 
 *		Boolean and null primitives: Boolean is a data type for true and false statements and null
 *			refers to values that are unset or set to 'nothing'. 
 * Beyond the primitive data types, we have object data types. These are data types that are 
 * created to have not only data as values but instructions as to what to do with them. These objects
 * can be real things like a creature in a game or an object on a map in a race.
